🏗️ BIG-DIG-HEAP

BIG-DIG-HEAP is a decentralized web archiving platform that enables users to capture, store, and retrieve high-fidelity snapshots of web content — powered by a Python backend and the Qortal decentralized network. Think archive.is meets decentralized storage: a resilient archive of web pages that lives on a peer-to-peer data network rather than centralized servers.

🚀 Overview

BIG-DIG-HEAP lets you:

📌 Submit live web URLs for archiving

📦 Store rendered snapshots (HTML, assets, screenshots, and optional WARC)

🔗 Publish archive manifests on the Qortal Data Network (QDN)

🌐 Retrieve snapshots via a decentralized Q-App frontend

📊 Track archive status and metadata through a RESTful API

“Dig deep into history — and keep it safe forever.”

🧠 Motivation

The modern web is ephemeral. Pages disappear or change without notice, yet many contain content we want preserved. Traditional archival systems are centralized and depend on single entities. BIG-DIG-HEAP moves archiving into a decentralized realm, leveraging Qortal’s blockchain and distributed storage to make archives resilient, censorship-resistant, and verifiable.

📦 Features

⭐ High-fidelity snapshots
✔ Full page HTML
✔ Screenshots
✔ Optional WARC (standard archive format)

🔐 Decentralized storage
✔ Manifest hashes on Qortal blockchain
✔ Content served by QDN

⚙️ Developer-friendly API
✔ REST endpoints
✔ Async job queue
✔ Metadata and retrieval

📱 Q-App integration
✔ Simple UI for users
✔ Native Qortal publishing and retrieval

🧩 Architecture

BIG-DIG-HEAP consists of:

* Crawler Subsystem
  * A Python service (using Playwright) that:
  * Renders dynamic web pages
  * Captures HTML, screenshots, and optionally WARC files
  * Produces archive manifests and asset bundles

* Backend API
  * A FastAPI service that:
    * Accepts archive requests
    * Queues crawl jobs
    * Reports status and metadata

* Orchestrates packaging and publishing

* Qortal Bridge

* A module that:
  * Publishes archive manifests to Qortal
  * Uploads chunks to QDN
  * Records immutable references on the blockchain

* Q-App Frontend
  * A lightweight JavaScript Qortal App that:
    * Lets users submit URLs for archiving
    * Displays status and snapshot history
    * Fetches archived content from decentralized storage

🛠️ Getting Started

* Prerequisites
  * Python 3.10+
  * Node.js & NPM
  * Docker (optional)
  * Qortal Core or access to Qortal API

🛠️ Quick Start

  * Clone the repo  
```
git clone https://github.com/8bittengeek/big-dig-heap.git
cd big-dig-heap
```
  * Launch development environment
```
docker compose up --build
```
  * Access services
  
Backend API: `http://localhost:8000`

Q-App UI: `http://localhost:8080`

API docs: `http://localhost:8000/docs`

🧪 Usage Examples
Submit a URL for Archiving
```
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/archive \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"url":"https://example.com"}'
```
Check Job Status
```
curl http://localhost:8000/archive/<JOB_ID>
```
---

🧠 How It Works

1. User submits a URL via the Q-App or REST API.

2. Backend queues a crawl job.

3. Crawler fetches and renders the page, then packages assets.

4. Archive manifest is generated and hashes computed.

5. Manifest uploaded to QDN; hashes committed to Qortal blockchain.

6. Snapshots can be retrieved via the Q-App or direct fetch from QDN.

# TECHNICAL DESIGN NOTES

🧠 Understanding the Key Concepts

1️⃣ What Qortal Provides

* Blockchain + Data Network (QDN): Qortal’s QDN lets you store encrypted, chunked data in a peer-to-peer network secured by the blockchain. 
Qortal

* Publishing Websites & Apps: Qortal supports publishing websites and apps (Q-Apps) that are hosted decentralized, fee-less and indefinitely. 
wiki.qortal.org

* Q-Apps API: JavaScript-based apps can interact with users and the blockchain through Qortal’s APIs, making it usable with modern front-ends. 
Qortal

* BIG-DIG-HEAP app will likely be a architecture — a crawler running on backend servers to fetch and snapshot web content, plus a Q-App frontend that interacts with Qortal for storage, retrieval, and distribution.

🧩 What Web Archiving Usually Involves

Before we plug into decentralized storage, let’s take a quick look at design patterns from existing archiving tools:

📌 Archive Tools & Techniques

* Archive.today / archive.is: Takes snapshots of a page’s appearance and static content and stores them for retrieval. 
Wikipedia

* Wayback Machine: Crawls and stores periodic snapshots for replay over time. 
Wikipedia

* ArchiveBox: Open-source tool for self-hosted web archiving and retrieval, can store HTML, JS, PDFs, screenshots, WARC files, media, etc. 

These tools mix crawling logic (download, render, process content) with storage formats (HTML, WARC, screenshots) that BIG-DIG-HEAP needs to model or interface with.

---

🛠️ Architecture Outline for BIG-DIG-HEAP

🧱 1. Crawler & Archival Backend

* Build a service (e.g., in Python, Go, Rust, or Node.js) that:

* Accepts a URL to archive

* Fetches the page (headless browser or HTTP fetch)

* Renders dynamic content (needs a headless browser like Puppeteer/Playwright)

* Extracts content (HTML, CSS, JS, media, images)

* Generates snapshots (HTML screenshot, PDF, WARC)

* Stores metadata (timestamp, hashes, dependencies)

* This is similar in intent to ArchiveBox but tailored to the needs of BIG-DIG-HEAP.

---

📦 2. Chunking & Storage Module

Because Qortal’s Data Network can store encrypted, chunked data, BIG-DIG-HEAP needs:

* A component to chunk archived data

* Compute content hashes

* Build a manifest describing the archive snapshot

* Publish a hash manifest transaction to Qortal so others can fetch and validate content. 
  
This step bridges archiving logic with Qortal’s decentralized storage layer.

---

🔗 3. Q-App Frontend

Develop a Q-App (likely JavaScript with a modern UI framework like React or Svelte) that:

* Lets users submit URLs to be archived

* Shows archival status and versions

* Lists archived snapshots with metadata

* Fetches archived content using QDN’s decentralized fetch APIs

The Q-App would interact with BIG-DIG-HEAP backend (crawler) and Qortal to coordinate storage and retrieval.

---

🛡️ 4. Security, Integrity & Versioning

* Every archived snapshot should include cryptographic hashes.

* Storing hashes in the blockchain gives immutable proof of content versioning.

* Consider formats like WARC, HTML + resource bundles, and even screenshots for extra fidelity.

* These patterns are widely used in the archival community because they help with verifiability and replay accuracy.
